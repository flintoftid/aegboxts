## Measurement data-sets 

The AEG measurement data-sets are licensed under a Creative Commons

The rationale for the use of the "no derivatives" clause for the measurement
data is that since the data-sets are primarily intended for validation
purposes it is not desirable for modified version of the data-sets to appear.
Note that this is not intended to prevent presentation of the data in the 
data-sets for comparison purposes in other works.
